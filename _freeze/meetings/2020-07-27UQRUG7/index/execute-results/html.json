I want to use strings in one column as object names in a function.\n* **Ruth** (HMNS): I don't have any specific issues this week. I am happy to listen and explore new packages.\n* **Chantelle Derez** (Biological Science): I don't have any specific issues, just popping in to learn. Current favourite package is Thermimage and colour palette 'rainbow' for analysing thermal images. :rainbow: \n* **Paula Andrea M** (CAI) I'm here to help. Also I would like to invite you to the Rladies Brisbane events. https://www.meetup.com/rladies-brisbane/events/272075776 The topic of next month is R in Biology. \n* **Fathin** (SAFS) No issue to date. \n* **Damber** (I want to learn plotting glmm prediction) - shared on chat.uq.edu as well.\n* **Candice**: RNAseq in R.\n    * Found resources:\n    * https://osca.bioconductor.org\n    * https://bioconductor.riken.jp/packages/3.8/workflows/html/simpleSingleCell.html \n* **Greg** (Chemical Engineering) Late but here to help.
