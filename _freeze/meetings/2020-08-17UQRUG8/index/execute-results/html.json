I have problems using the right code for missing data and doing linear regression with categorical data. I am happy to learn other things as well!\n* **Fathin** (SAFS): Problem yet to come, haha. I am going to add moving average on my boxplot. Don't know how can I do that.\n* **Patrick** ($SAFS$): I got a problem of GLM(). Plotting multiple model over a time period. \n* **Elspeth** Hi, I just started learning R last week as well. Just here to learn generally, no specific problem :)\n* **Paula** CAI. I want to show you between and near for filters, using tidyverse\n* **Evan** (QBI) Been using R for stats for about 3 years, will be doing some bioinformatics for PhD, and joining in to meet other people also using R (no specific problem - yet)\n* **Jemima** Want to understand some warning messages in my CLMM analyses\n\n\n#### Shared resources\n\n* Jemima's CLMM and stats questions:\n    * Patrick: \"My biometrician recommended AIC the lower the better\"\n    * Evan: \"this guide to fitting clmm that might be helpful as well\": https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ordinal/vignettes/clmm2_tutorial.pdf \n    * Paula: https://www.scribbr.com/statistics/akaike-information-criterion/#:~:text=The%20AIC%20function%20is%202K,it%20is%20being%20compared%20to \n    * Fathin recommends this QCIF course: _Exploring and Predicting using Linear Regression in R_ -- https://www.qcif.edu.au/trainingcourses/exploring-and-predicting-using-linear-regression/ \n    * Stéphane: the first warning you saw is related to recent R changes (in R 4.0) and it will be fixed in a future version of ordinal: https://github.com/runehaubo/ordinal/issues/34\n* Patrick's plotting of multiple models over time:\n    * Paula: http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/32-r-graphics-essentials/128-plot-time-series-data-using-ggplot/ \n* Cheatsheets: https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/\n* Join R-Ladies!\n    * Brisbane: https://www.meetup.com/rladies-brisbane/\n        * on Twitter: https://twitter.com/RLadiesBrisbane/\n    * Global: https://rladies.org/\n\n\n",
