UQRUG has one year!!**\n\n\n#### Attendees and questions\n\n* **Paula Martinez** I'm a keen R user, I also founded R Ladies Brisbane and you are welcome to join https://www.meetup.com/rladies-brisbane/\n* **Kathy**: Phd SSI, wants to learn more R\n* **David Green**: RCC, hacky hour\n* **Stéphane Guillou** (Library): keen to start UQRUG again for 2021! \n* **Phoebe**: Just hanging to learn something :)\n* **Isabel** (IMB), microbiologist, here to meet other R folks and learn :) \n\n\n#### Naming things\n\nPaula presented these very useful slides by [Jenny Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/) about how to name files and directory for profit!\n\n* Link to the slides: https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files\n* Steph couldn't remember what that padding function was, but discovered stringr has a great one, `str_pad()`: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stringr/versions/1.4.0/topics/str_pad\n\nFor example, try this:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstringr::str_pad(c(0, 14, 178), width = 3, pad = 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### This week's TidyTuesday\n\nHave fun with this week's [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): the rKenyaCensus dataset.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get the Data manually\n\ngender <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-19/gender.csv')\ncrops <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-19/crops.csv')\nhouseholds <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-01-19/households.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Resources shared\n\n* RStudio Global conference was last week. Recordings will be available on the [RStudio website](https://blog.rstudio.com/) soon.\n    * Stéphane really recommends the presentation: _How to do things with words: learning to program in R with a \"communicative approach\"_, by [Riva Quiroga](https://rivaquiroga.cl/)\n* Main R terms for beginners: https://gitlab.com/stragu/DSH/-/blob/master/R/terminology.md\n    * Don't hesitate to send Steph some feedback!\n* Converting Windows style to Unix:\nhttps://support.nesi.org.nz/hc/en-gb/articles/218032857-Converting-from-Windows-style-to-UNIX-style-line-endings\n* Notepad++, useful (open source) text editor which has an option to change file endings: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\n* `theme_publish()`, a ggplot2 theme provided by the package envalysis: https://rdrr.io/github/zsteinmetz/envalysis/man/theme_publish.html\n* https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/ to watch the presentations from the last RStudio conferences\n* Visual Markdown editor in the new RStudio 1.4: https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/09/30/rstudio-v1-4-preview-visual-markdown-editing/\n* Bar plots guide: https://michaeltoth.me/detailed-guide-to-the-bar-chart-in-r-with-ggplot.html\n* Two-way anova: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/two-way-anova-test-in-r\n* Other packages built on top of ggplot2: https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/\n\n\n\n#### Phoebe's faceted visualisation\n\nPhoebe needed to reshape her dataset to then visualise it in separate facets.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n CBMI %>% \n        select(Gender, contains(\"BMI\")) %>% \n        pivot_longer(contains(\"BMI\"), names_to=\"Year\", values_to=\"BMI\") %>% \n        mutate(Year=fct_inorder(Year)) %>% \n        ggplot(aes(x=Gender, y=BMI)) + \n        geom_boxplot() +\n        facet_grid(cols=vars(Year)) +\n        theme_pubr()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n#### Recommendations for Katherine's bar chart\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# useful geometries:\ngeom_bar() # height of a bar is a count\ngeom_col() # if you already have the value for the height of the bar\n\n# to have bars side by side, change the position to \"dodge\"\n# (instead of the default \"stack\"), for example:\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = as.character(cyl), fill = class)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n# for adding error bars\ngeom_errorbar()\n# you have to provide the values for the size of the bars (xmin, xmax)\n# and their position (x, y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou might find that an extra package to add on top of ggplot2 will do the hard work for you. Many are listed here: https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/\n\nMore resources:\n* Bar plots guide: https://michaeltoth.me/detailed-guide-to-the-bar-chart-in-r-with-ggplot.html\n* Two way anova: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/two-way-anova-test-in-r\n\n\n",
