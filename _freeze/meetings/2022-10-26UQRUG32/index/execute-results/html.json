Without manually creating each y scale.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data transformation\ntrial %>% \n  pivot_longer(c(2:3), names_to = \"events\", values_to = \"review\") %>% \n  count(events, review) %>% \n  rbind(tibble(events = c(\"eventA review\", \"eventA review\"),\n               review = c(\"bad\", \"very bad\"),\n               n = c(NA, NA))) %>%\n  mutate(events = as.factor(events),\n         review = as.factor(review)) %>% \n# plot\n  ggplot(aes(y = review, x = n, fill = events)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(~events) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n##### Sogra stat comparison issue\n\nSogra has a large dataset of protein observations and needs to compare between different groups.\n\nUsing the package **MSstats** Sogra needs to re-export that data.\n\n##### Semira\n\nSemira is trying to change the colours of the diamonds in a forest plot created using the **meta** package. We've tried change the col.diamonds to set the colours, however this changed all of the boxes in the forest plot.\n",
