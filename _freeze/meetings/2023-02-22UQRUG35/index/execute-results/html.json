But is it possible?\n\nThere is an issue with marking free language data. You may want to be looking for certain keywords.\n\nYou would likely run into issues with nuance and insight.\n\nIf the questions can be answered by a machine, then it can be marked by a machine. If it requires insight, then no.\n\nTo do this in R would likely require a lot of backend work to effectively create an AI similar to chatGPT which is capable of dealing with free text input, and providing feedback from there.\n\n\n##### What are you using R for?\n\n* I am using R for Reporting and data analysis.\n* I use R for data analysis and graphs\n* I use R to analyse data. Big data. Running loops in parallel has proved difficult. Using parallel and foreach\n* Environmental analysis - using seqinr and BALCONY\n* I use R for bioinformatics for dna sequencing analysis.\n\n\n",
