How do you interpret the code snippets from the user guide for shelf? Does anyone have experience plotting a probability density function on R? BRMS Package might be useful to run the models. ggplot has [geom_density](http://sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-density-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization) and geom_boxplot\n\n##### Giulio Centorame - Qs on functional programming in R\n\nGiulio has some functions that have nested loops on big data. The advice is to explore the R package parallel. RCC may have some suggestions. You could try attending Hacky Hour, and seeing if David Green. Nick will explore with GeoSpatial Community regarding using parallel. You can try making your code just a little more efficient and this will flow on to save a lot of time in loops.\n\n##### Anna - glm() function question\n\nWhat is the A plus is adding it as a single interaction An Asterisk is adding the relationship between two factors as a factor A comma is a another argument in the function, and offset is an argument for the glm() function\n\n##### Anna - R Markdown\n\nYes you do need to do data wrangling in markdown before you run analyses on the data. You don't need to treat each block of code as an individual entity. You only need to run your wrangling once per document.\n\n##### Jayne - Eyes on my code\n\nDog temperature code.\n",
