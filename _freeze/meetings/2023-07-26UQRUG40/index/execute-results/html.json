You can look for the upcomming sessions in this website:\n  * <https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training>\n* After doing that training, you're more than welcome to bring questions that you have to UQRUG\n\n---\n\n#### Q2 - knit Shiny/plotly objects to local html - Mikesh\nSolutions for saving Rmarkdown files with shiny objects locally (no server)? \nWant to allow someone without R installed on their computer, access the interactive html file. maybe todays session?...\n\n**Answers**\n\n* Nick - I haven't tried combining shiny and quarto, as Shiny will always need that Shiny server running, so I try to stick to HTML related dependencies.\n* If you want to have a quarto website or presentation, you can easily publish them to a variety of free sites such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Quarto Pub:\n    * <https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/>\n*  @Mikesh When you are thinking about this data access question again, please reach out to me via rcc-support@uq.edu.au\n\n---\n\n#### Q3 - How to get cmdstanr working - Fran\nWhen I run cmdstan R, I get a make error.\n```{.r}\ncmdstanr:::get_cmdstan_flags('STANCFLAGS')\nError in `(function (command = NULL, args = character(), error_on_status = TRUE, â€¦`:\n! System command 'make' failed\n---\nExit status: 2\nStderr:\nmake: *** /c/Users/uqfpowe1/OneDrive: Is a directory.  Stop.\n---\n```\n\n**Answers**\n\n*  We spent a while working on this one. Eventually David, Valentina, Nick, and Fran managed to get it working.\n*  The issue appears to be that cmdstanr is for some reason pointing at the OneDrive, rather than the local C: drive\n*  We tried changing the standard working directory, but this did not work\n*  We also pulled everything off of OneDrive that was associated with R and cmdstanr, but it still wasn't working\n*  David got us to open the makefile command file inside the cmdstanr installation folder and we found that it was hard coded to run from the $HOME directory.\n*  This is apparently different to the working directory. We found that we could check what this was with the following code:\n    * `Sys.getenv(\"HOME\")`\n* We were able to change this with the following code:\n  * `Sys.setenv(HOME=\"C:/Users/MyName/Documents\")`\n* We then had the code working.\n\n---\n",
