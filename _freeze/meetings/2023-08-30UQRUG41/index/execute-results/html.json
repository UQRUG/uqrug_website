Already aware of Bootnet, igraph, visNetwork and threejs, but haven't explored them a lot yet. Looking for more options and opinions on packages.\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   Raul: I think the most used is igraph, I also experimented with networkD3, it has smoother outputs but it has less options. Anyway, all of them are quite difficult to use, for me it was a lot of trial and error to get the simplest of networks \\>\\_\\<. In general I'll recomend igraph as it covers most of basic needs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q2 - What are some good R packages for bayesian analysis? (Prior distributions) - Yufan\n\nI would like to know if there are any online resources that teach you how to fomulate prior distributions using R.\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   <https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/surveil/html/priors.html>\n-   rstanarm - <https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/priors.html>\n-   <https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/BayesCombo/html/plot.PPH.html>\n-   <https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q3 - How to transform a .cvs file into an .nc file - Lucas\n\nI have a .cvs file with contains temperature values per month. Also it has attached lon and lat values. I need those values on QGIS, but i need them separate by month into a raster file.\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   Nick - I'll follow up with you on this later. We may be able to explore using the [stars](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/) R package to achieve this\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q4 - Normality of Residuals or Data points? - Kar\n\nTo test for one of the assumption - data normality before deciding the suitable omnibus and post-doc test, which \"normality\" are we looking at? Residual normality or Data value normality\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   Raul: In general, Residual normality is used to test if your data adjust to a linear model. When a test (like ANOVA) has a normality assumption is ussualy refer to normality of data (value). But it will depend on the test.\n-   Kar: Thank you very much Raul.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q5 - How do you calculate intra class corelations? - Bernadette\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   Using the irr package which has a icc function. Then you simply feed that the dataframe and the parameters/model you're using to calculate the corrlelations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q6 - For multiple linear regression, how can we plot it and what's the graph look like? - Jay\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   Raul:Maybe this will help? <https://rpubs.com/bensonsyd/385183> \"however, in many multiple linear regression situations, the variables we are using cannot be simultaneously represented two-dimensionally so exploring the data visually is far more difficult\". All good. It looks like we can't really graph multiple linear regression easily. Thanks a lot.\n\nMaybe explore these visualisations? <https://statsandr.com/blog/multiple-linear-regression-made-simple/#visualizations-1>\n\n-   If there are interactions between multiple variables then you can't visualise that easily.\n-   You would have to visualise the plot at different levels of the interaction, as the slope and corrleation would be different at every level of the interaction\n-   If you have 2 independent variables, you need three dimensions to visualise each variable, and their interaction. OR have a 2D plot at each level of the interaction - like slices through each of those\n-   The only time this is fine is if there is no interaction between the variables, and you can collapse that extra dimension.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q7 - Does anyone know of good R packages for reverse geocoding? - Chris\n\nFor example nearest street address to a GPS coordinate\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   <https://rdrr.io/cran/tmaptools/man/rev_geocode_OSM.html>\n-   <https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q8 - Does anyone know how to conduct LD analysis using genepop in R? - Ola\n\n**Answers**\n\n-   Raul: Not familiar with genepop package, but according to the manual, they have a LD (linkage desequilibrium) test. The function is\n\n``` r\ntest_LD(\ninputFile,\noutputFile = \"\",\nsettingsFile = \"\",\ndememorization = 10000,\nbatches = 100,\niterations = 5000,\nverbose = interactive()\n)\n```\n",
