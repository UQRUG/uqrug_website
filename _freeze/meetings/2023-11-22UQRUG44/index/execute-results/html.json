Network is developed based on the correlation coefficient. \nR Package called ts2net\n\n**Answers**\n*  Cat: Might have a link to share that could help with this\n\nThis is a time series workshop that UQ Library put together: https://qaehs-lib-rtimeseries2022.netlify.app/\n\nPradeepa,if your question is about neural networks: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stablelearner/stablelearner.pdf\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q2 - Pros and cons of using R markdown versus word to write journal articles? - Noah\nAny extra details\n\n**Answers**\nCan use Zotero plugged into R to do in-text citations. Unsure if you can use EndNote or Mendeley for the same purposes.\n\n[R-Ladies Brisbane YouTube video](https://youtu.be/AsIzd1f-JUA?si=tSL-vIcFwTTjKZV6)\n\nPro:\n* Have your code and text in the same document.\n* Markdown could be better for formulas with latex.\n* Can do citations in Rmd with Zotero - need a plugin (betterbibtex?) for Zotero to make unique IDs for each citation.\n* Can export the one document to .docx, .pdf, .html (for slides or as a website)\n\nCon:\n* May have to export to word anyway depending on what the journal accepts.\n* Non-programmers would struggle (if collaborating).\n* Can be fiddly.\n\nSemi-related, unofficial UQ thesis template for Rmarkdown:\nhttps://github.com/gsiemon/UQThesis\nAntique Article 2014: \nhttps://archive.blogs.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2014/08/29/switching-to-markdown-for-scholarly-article-production/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q3 - Are there packages that allow you to put your own images in R? - edenn subset the data I Answers**\n*  Jocelyn: I just stumbled upon rsvg and ggsvg to add svg images into a ggplot. Also magick package.\n*  Nick: ggimage works just like ggdogs\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#### Q4 - How to reduce loading time for large plotly graph? - Jocelyn\nI have created some plotly graphs that have a lot of data points and takes a long time to load. Is there a function that I can use so that R is a repeated measurement? Or say to R the Period and Animals they are the experimental unit?\n\n**Answers**\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### Q5 - Correlations in R? - Eden\nAny extra details\n\n**Aneed into plotly\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------",
