Anybody know how is there a way to left align the text again within ggploty?\n\n\n**Answers**\n*  There might be a way using plotly layouts, but we will have to do some digging for this.\n    *  https://plotly.com/r/reference/layout/\n*  Alternatively, you may be better off creating the chart in plotly from the start... though this requires learning plotly.\n\n---\n\n#### Q2 - Jocelyn - There are certain packages that I use all the time, is there a way to load these packages by default in R Studio?\nAny extra details\n\n**Answers**\n\n* David - Create a text file that has a list of all the packages you want to run at the start of each script you use.\n* ``source(file_containing_library()_commands)``\n* Cameron - I like David's answer because it's not as hard-coded, but you can do it by adjusting your Rprofile.site file.\n    1. Navigate to your R home directory (where R, not RStudio, is stored). You can find this by running `R.home()`\n    2. Inside this directory, navigate to `/R-4.x.x/etc/RProfile.site`, open this file (you can use RStudio)\n    3. Insert the lines `library(package)` for each package you want to import as per normal.\n\n    Alternatively, you can use `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES = 'package1, package2, package3, ...'` inside this Rprofile.site file to specify all the default packages you want, but it will override the normal defaults, meaning they *won't* be imported unless you specify them too.\n    \n    Personally, I think David's solution is better.\n\n----\n\n\n#### Q3 - DavidG - Comment about how pandoc does its thing\n\nThis diagram and paragraph explains what happens while knitr is rendering\nhttps://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/15-knitr-markdown.html#how-things-get-compiled\n\n**Answers**\n\n----\n\n\n#### Q4 - Renna - I need to analyse data statistically across different factors/categories in the specific columns. I am still new to using R, so I can proceed that one by one. How can I do it by using for loop? Sorry for the trivial question :D\nAny extra details\n\n**Answers**\n\nSet up a loop with parameters similar to what is below\n```r\nfor (i in c(\"t1\", \"t2\", \"t3\")) {\n\n}\n```\nYou would need to assign the output of this to a dataframe \n\n----\n\n#### Q5 - Sy - Question: How to get rid of gridlines of uneven thickness in a heatmap? \nggplot2 heatmap has large gridlines on the left and thin ones on the right.\n\n\n\n**Answers**\n\nThere seems to be something weird happening when the image is exported.\nSomething to explore later.\n\n----\n#### Q6 - Danelle - Question: I'm combining dataframes using tidy and the tibble is populating normally, but writing to excel loses the column headings. I've tried header=TRUE and that didn't help. Any idea how to retain column headings from tibble to excel?\nAny extra details\n\n**Answers**",
