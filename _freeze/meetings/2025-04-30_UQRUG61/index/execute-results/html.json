This makes it less likely to run into issues when the dependencies change, and is nicer for others who use your code and appreciate having to install less things.\n\n-   You can also create tests as you develop your project, and run those tests regularly to see if they fail. (For example: \"Check that the value returned by this function is exactly this number.\") A useful package for that is {testthat}: <https://testthat.r-lib.org/>\n\n### How do I switch R version in RStudio?\n\n-   In Windows (possibly also Mac)   Tools / Global Options / General / R Sessions ... R Version (select one that is already installed)\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   In linux use the utility ... \\[\\@Stephane\\] ?\n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   To select R version on starting RStudio, hold the Ctrl key as RStudio starts. \n\n<!-- -->\n\n-   The change of default R version seems to stick afterwards.\n\nHow to update the R version, using the {installr} package on Windows: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P11imusqX0U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P11imusqX0U&ab_channel=ModernValuationGroup)\n\n## Shared resources\n\nResources shared during the meeting.\n\n-   Hacky Hour, 3-4 pm every Tuesday (online)\n\n    -   <https://rcc.uq.edu.au/training-support/meetups>\n\n    -   ask us for the Zoom link!\n",
