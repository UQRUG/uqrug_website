The `sinfo` command tells us the state of all the nodes in a partition.\n\n```         \n[davidg@bunya1 ~]$ sinfo -p general\nPARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST\ngeneral      up 14-00:00:0      1  down$ bun009\ngeneral      up 14-00:00:0      1  drain bun023\ngeneral      up 14-00:00:0     39    mix bun[008,010-011,026,034,045-050,060,062,083-086,088,090,092-095,097,099-105,108-115]\ngeneral      up 14-00:00:0     54  alloc bun[006-007,012-022,024-025,027-033,035-044,051-059,061,063-067,087,089,091,096,098,106-107]\n\n\n[davidg@bunya1 ~]$ sinfo -p gpu_cuda\nPARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST\ngpu_cuda     up 7-00:00:00      1  down$ bun003\ngpu_cuda     up 7-00:00:00     16    mix bun[004-005,068,071-082,116]\n```\n\nThe node states will usually be one of\n\n-   idle (no jobs),\n-   mix (mixed, some space left for new jobs),\n-   alloc (fully allocated),\n-   drain (emptying, usually for maintenance),\n-   down (faulty or down for maintenance)\n\n#### There is the possibility of interactive use BUT ...\n\nInteractive use *must* still be mediated by the batch system to fairly share the resources.\n\nThis ensures that the computation takes place on a compute nodes.\n\nInstalling R packages must *not* be done on the login nodes. Getting in early ;-)\n\nInteractive graphical usage of R can be achieved using\n\n-   interactive command line jobs with X11 forwarding enabled\n-   Bunya-on-demand via a web browser\n\nSo, yes, you can run RStudio. Indeed, *two* ways!\n\n### The implications for your R code\n\nSome of the benefits of moving to HPC are access to potentially\n\n-   thousands of CPU cores,\n-   terabytes of RAM,\n-   fast temporary disk for large data sets,\n-   ease of use of RDM storage for archiving data.\n\nSome of the challenges:\n\n-   managing your source code across platforms\n-   modifications for locations\n-   locating R software and pre-built libraries\n-   handling the different CPU architectures\n-   letting go of the notion of an all encompassing R script\n\n### Using R on Bunya\n\n-   There is a great deal of software installed on Bunya.\n-   You just need to be able to find it!\n-   Environment modules (based on lmod) does all the \"dirty work\".\n-   You can activate/deactivate access to installed software.\n-   The central installations of R will have LOTS of \"extensions\" (R packages).\n-   If you need some exotic R package, you are able to install it yourself.\n\n#### How to activate R in your session\n\n```         \n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ module purge\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ module load r/4.3.3-gfbf-2023a\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ which Rscript\n/sw/auto/rocky8c/epyc3/software/R/4.3.3-gfbf-2023a/bin/Rscript\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ cat demo.R\n1+1\n2+2\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ Rscript demo.R\n[1] 2\n[1] 4\n```\n\n#### Where is it going to search for R packages?\n\n```         \n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ module purge\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ module load r/4.2.1-foss-2022a\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ which R\n/sw/auto/rocky8c/epyc3/software/R/4.2.1-foss-2022a/bin/R\n\n[uqdgree5@bun048 R]$ R\n\nR version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) -- \"Funny-Looking Kid\"\nCopyright (C) 2022 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.\nType 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.\n\n  Natural language support but running in an English locale\n\nR is a collaborative project with many contributors.\nType 'contributors()' for more information and\n'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.\n\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\nType 'q()' to quit R.\n\n[Previously saved workspace restored]\n\n> .libPaths()\n[1] \"/home/uqdgree5/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2\"\n[2] \"/sw/auto/rocky8c/epyc3/software/R/4.2.1-foss-2022a/lib64/R/library\"\n> q()\nSave workspace image?

Simplest would look like\n\n-   strip away one of the layers of the nested for loop (e.g. i)\n-   pass i parameter values in as parameters to the R script\n-   use the `commandArgs` function to accept the value into your code\n-   for each value of i, `Rscript scriptName.R i`\n\n#### Job Arrays\n\nBunya has support for \"Job Arrays\" which make sweeping over integer parameter values straightforward.\n\nJob arrays can be adapted to sweep non-integer parameters, too.\n\nJob arrays on Bunya are limited to 1,000 elements, but you can submit more than one to the batch system.\n\n#### Nimrod\n\nUQ RCC will be adding a tool called Nimrod to Bunya later this year.\n\nThat will make it easier to sweeps over combinations of parameters that are not integers.\n\nNimrod can sweep over parameters values that are\n\n-   floating point values,\n-   sets of character strings,\n-   a list filenames found in a directory,\n-   etc.\n\n## In summary\n\n*The possibilities that arise from combining R with HPC are well worth the learning curve!*\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n.\n",
