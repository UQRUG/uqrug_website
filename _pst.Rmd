#### **Topics discussed and code**

**Presentation on gganimate and plotly animations**
Nick Wiggins did a presentation on animations in gganimate and plotly. He showed some examples of how these can be used to make your graphs somewhat more interesting, and in the case of plotly, interactive.
[gganimate](https://gganimate.com/)
[plotly](https://plotly.com/r/animations/)

**Chuan questions about using barplot**
Chuan was using a barplot to show data which referred to the responses of multiple species across a number of tests.
When using the same code for a slightly different sample group, the colours on the chart changed. We spent some time trying to find the cause of this, such as slight differences in the code, but we didn't come to a solution.
We will next try converting the data to fit into a ggplot.

**Olive Dang ggplot2 legend order**
Olive needed help changing the order of some variables in a ggplot legend. We accomplished this by turning that column of the dataframe into a facotr with levels. E.g. :
```
df$col <- factor(df$col, levels=c('a', 'b', 'c'))
```
**Olive Dang ggplot2 and ggarrange making all the graphs the same size**
Olive had a second question about ggplot when exporting them onto the same page. There was an issue where they weren't lining up very well (the top graph was smaller). We spent some time trying to resolve this issue, however, it turns out that there is an argument in **ggarrange** which allows you to quickly make them the same size. The `align` argument allows you to align graphs along the vertical axis, horizontal axis, or both.

**Ainnatul Adawiyah Ahmad Termizi on using R over Excel**
Ainnatul wanted to recreate some graphs and statistical analyses that had been made in Excel in R. We recommended checking out some of the [introduction to R classes](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training/blob/master/R/rstudio_intro/rstudio_intro.md) that we run, as well as the [ANOVA class](https://github.com/uqlibrary/technology-training/blob/master/R/ANOVA-lm/anova-lm.md) that we have a guide for.

#### Topics discussed and code

##### Presentation on quanteda
Nick Wiggins did a presentation on the quanteda package  to give an overview and introduction to the package and how he has recently used it to assist a researcher.
https://quanteda.io/

##### Kar ggplot facet_wrap label issue
Kar has the below sample data set:
```
MyID	eventA review	eventB review	eventC review
id_68	very good	neutral	
id_30	very good	very good	
id_15	good	very good	
id_1	neutral	very good	
![](https://s3.hedgedoc.org/demo/uploads/6f9d7f0d-202b-4549-b7b1-186dbe9bb093.png)

```
He is trying to create a facet_wrap in ggplot that includes labels that are missing from the data, but needed to scale "bad" & "very bad", while having the y labels showing on every facet. Without manually creating each y scale.
```{r}
# Data transformation
trial %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(2:3), names_to = "events", values_to = "review") %>% 
  count(events, review) %>% 
  rbind(tibble(events = c("eventA review", "eventA review"),
               review = c("bad", "very bad"),
               n = c(NA, NA))) %>%
  mutate(events = as.factor(events),
         review = as.factor(review)) %>% 
# plot
  ggplot(aes(y = review, x = n, fill = events)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~events) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
##### Sogra stat comparison issue

Sogra has a large dataset of protein observations and needs to compare between different groups.

Using the package **MSstats** Sogra needs to re-export that data.

##### Semira

Semira is trying to change the colours of the diamonds in a forest plot created using the **meta** package.
We've tried change the col.diamonds to set the colours, however this changed all of the boxes in the forest plot.

#### Attendees

* **Luke**: Library | here to help
* **Valentina**: Library | Listen, learn and help
* **Tianjian**: Economics | Listen and learn
* **Nick**: Library | here to help

#### Topics discussed and code

### 2022-08-24: UQRUG 30

#### Attendees

* **Luke**: Library | here to help
* **Chris Mancini**: Civil Engineering | Read multiple CSVs and Shiny question
* **Tayla Lawrie**: NA | Listen and learn
* **Wilson**: Student Affairs | Listen and learn
* **Valentina**: Library | Listen, learn and help
* **Nick**: Library | here to help


#### Topics discussed and code

How to read multiple csv files in as separate variables efficiently for a Shiny app.
Looked at creating a list of files, and then using the read_csv function in rdrr package to read them in.

Tried a lapply(files,read_csv) but this just creates a list of the files.
Found a package known as easycsv which has a function called loadcsv_multi()

```
loadcsv_multi(directory)
```

### 2022-07-27: UQRUG 29

#### Attendees

* **Luke**: Library | here to help and say hello
* **Rene**: Pharmacy | Listen and learn
* **David**: Honours in Science | Histogram ggplot2 issue
* **Wilson**: Student Affairs | Listen and learn
* **Lily**: Honours in Economics | Learning R for course


#### Topics discussed and code

Creating a normal distribution line for a histogram.
Using ggplot geom_histogram() and the stat_function() creates the plot, but the line and histogram are scaled differently on the y axis. 

Needed to scale the stat_function() by the binwidth times observations using a defined function.

```
bw = .5

ggplot(SS, aes(DIA)) +
  geom_histogram( binwidth =  bw)+ 
  stat_function(fun =function(x)
dnorm(x,mean = mean(SS$DIA),sd = sd(SS$DIA))*bw*64) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "grey50"),
  panel.grid.major.y  = element_line(colour = "grey"),
  axis.text = element_text(size=12,family = ("TT Times New Roman"), 
  colour =  'black')) +
  xlab("Inhibitory zone diameter (mm)")+ylab("number of isolates")
```

#### Topics discussed and code

##### Iterating instead of using repetitive code

The trick here is to:

1. Encapsulate the repetitive code into a function, exposing the things that are likely to change as arguments
2. Create a vector of values (or several)
3. Use a for loop, or an `apply()` function, or a `map()` function (from purrr) to map the function to each element

```r
# iterating

?mean
# custom function
custom_mean <- function (numbers, trim_ratio) {
  # process the data
  my_mean <- mean(x = numbers, trim = trim_ratio, na.rm = TRUE)
  # save the it as file
  saveRDS(my_mean, file = paste0(numbers[1], trim_ratio, ".rds"))
}

# use the function
custom_mean(c(1,5,NA), 0.2)

# iterate
list_to_iterate_on <- list(c(1,5,NA),
     c(1,4,6,8),
     c(1,2,7,9,NA))

trim_ratios <- c(0.2, 0.7, 0.1)

library(purrr)
# alternative to apply functions or for loops
map2(list_to_iterate_on, trim_ratios, custom_mean)

# pmap(): construct a dataframe of all combinations,
# with each column containing the argument values to use

# construct the dataframe of all combinations
animal <- c("magpie", "pelican", "ibis")
treatment <- c("dry food", "sludge", "grain")
# only three rows
experiment <- data.frame(animal, treatment)
# all combinations
library(tidyr)
all_combinations <- expand(experiment, animal, treatment)

```

##### List files

```r
# listing files
list.files() # all files in working directory
only_rds <- list.files(pattern = "rds")
only_rds <- list.files("analysis", "rds")
only_rds
# full path (from working directory)
only_rds <- list.files("analysis", "rds", full.names = TRUE)
only_rds
```

##### Remove file extension from path

```r
# remove file extension from path
library(stringr)
str_replace("filename.txt", ".txt", "")
```

##### Extract information from filenames

Using the tidyverse and pdftools for preparing PDF text before analysis with quanteda. pdftools was used for its specific ability to return the page numbers of the pdfs.

```r
library(pdftools)
library(tidyverse)

# create a list of the PDF file paths
myfiles <- list.files(path = "./pdfs", pattern = "*.pdf", all.files = FALSE,
                      full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE,
                      ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = TRUE, no.. = FALSE)

# Function to import each pdf file, and place the text in a dataframe
import_pdf <- function(k){
    # turn the pdf into a text list each page will become a row
  pdf.text <- pdftools::pdf_text(k)
    # flatten the list
  pdf.text<-unlist(pdf.text)
  pdfdf <- data_frame(pdf.text)
    # turn the list into a dataframe, extracting the year from the path and using the separate function to extract the state from the path
  data_frame(pdf.text) %>%
    mutate(year = str_extract(k, "[:digit:]{4}") %>% as.integer(), pagenumber = row.names(pdfdf), filename = k) %>% 
    separate(filename, c(NA,NA,"state",NA), sep = "/")
  
}
    # run the function on all pdf files
all_pdfs<- map_dfr(myfiles, import_pdf)
```

### 2022-06-01: UQRUG 27

#### Attendees

* **Stéphane**: Library, here to help!
* **Emma**: looking for some help editing a graphic with ggplot2
* **Rene**: just tagging along
* **Laura**: working on GLMs
* **Leonie**: both tagging along and hoping for some help with the adehabitat package
* **Chris**: just tagging along

* ...and 6 other UQRUGers!

#### Topics discussed and code

* ggplot2 customisation: moving legend, filtering data out
    * [Cédric Scherer's slides](https://www.cedricscherer.com/slides/OutlierConf2021_ggplot-wizardry.pdf) (with customisation of legend using the `guides()` function)

```r
library(dplyr)
# do not keep these three eye colours
starwars %>% 
  filter(!eye_color %in% c("blue", "yellow", "green"))
```
* Preparation for species distribution modelling. Convert dataframe to sf object with `st_as_sf()`, and will probably need to go from vector data to raster data with `terra::rasterize()`
    * The [CRAN Task View on spatial data](https://CRAN.R-project.org/view=Spatial) lists a lot of useful packages
* Importing spatial points for dolphin occurences, using sf. Constructing a convex hull from them and visualising on an interactive map:

```r
# read CSV as dataframe
dolph <- read.csv("Adehabitat.csv")

library(sf)
# convert the dataframe to an sf object
dolph_sf <- st_as_sf(dolph, coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"))
# see it with default plot method
plot(dolph_sf)

# interactive map
library(tmap)
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(dolph_sf) +
  tm_dots()

# convex hull
dolph_hull <- st_convex_hull(st_union(dolph_sf))

# visualise both
tm_shape(dolph_hull) +
  tm_borders() +
tm_shape(dolph_sf) +
  tm_dots()
```

* Detecting anomalies in chronological sequence of a dataframe. `dplyr::lag()` and `dplyr::lead()` functions can be used for comparisons. `any()` and `all()` help reducing many logical values to one.
* R Markdown troubles: Rmd is self-contained and needs to include all the necessary code. Its working directory is by default the directory where the .Rmd file is saved.
* factoextra's `fviz_pca*()` functions for PCA, colouring points per group.
    * [STHDA has examples](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/fviz-pca-quick-principal-component-analysis-data-visualization-r-software-and-data-mining)

##### Tide data

```r=
# Whyte island, station measuring tide level

path <- "http://opendata.tmr.qld.gov.au/Whyte_Island.txt"
# read with base function, ignore first lines, keep two columns
tide_data <- read.table(path, skip = 5)[,1:2]
# name the column
names(tide_data) <- c("date_time", "LAT")

# same with readr
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
tide_data <- read_table(path, skip = 5,
                        col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  select(1:2) %>% 
  rename(date_time = 1, LAT = 2)

# split the date time
library(lubridate)
tide_data <- tide_data %>% 
  mutate(date_time = dmy_hm(date_time))
# filter and visualise
library(ggplot2)
tide_data %>% 
  filter(LAT > 0.01) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date_time, y = LAT)) +
  geom_line()

# save only the first time:
# write.csv(tide_data, "all_tide_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# append new data
all_tide_data <- read_csv("all_tide_data.csv")
all_tide_data <- bind_rows(all_tide_data, tide_data) %>% 
  unique() # check for duplicates
# overwrite file

#### Topics discussed and code

##### Big raster files
Use terra instead of raster, and use a temporary directory:

```r
library(terra)
terraOptions(tempdir = "path to somewhere with lots of space")
as.points() # instead of rasterToPoints()
```

The [Research Computing Centre](https://rcc.uq.edu.au/) can also provide access to supercomputers

##### [Patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) for joining plots made with [ggforestplot](https://nightingalehealth.github.io/ggforestplot/articles/ggforestplot.html)

To merge two plots with the same y-axis. After creating Forest plot 1 (with y-axis labels), create Forest plot 2 with y-axis labels removed:

```r
library(ggforestplot)
F2plot <- 
  forestplot(
    df = F2,
    name = term,
    estimate = estimate,
    se = std.error,
    pvalue = p.value,
    psignif = 0.05, 
    title = "Plot 2",
    xlab = "estimate",
    ylab = element_text(family = "", size = 10)
  )+ 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())
```
Or try replacing text in ylab (above) to ylab = ""

Then merge the plots:

```r
library(patchwork)
F1plot / F2plot
```

##### Slow `check_model()`

`check_model()` in [performance](https://easystats.github.io/performance/) package: weird behaviour in R Markdown, takes too long to execute. Richard might come back later with the answer!

#### Code snippets

Change the order of categorical variable levels (so ggplot2 uses that order instead of the alphabetical order):

```r
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
                          
# relevel factors using forcats package
library(forcats)
f <-  factor(c("a", "b", "c", "d"), levels = c("b", "c", "d", "a"))
fct_relevel(f, "a", "c", "d", "b")

# relevel eye_color of starwars data

starwars %>% 
   mutate(eye_color = fct_relevel(eye_color, "yellow")) %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = eye_color)) +
   geom_bar()
```

Use case_when to rate or recode data:

```r
library(dplyr)

starwars
range(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)

# just based on height
starwars_rated <-  starwars %>% 
   mutate(height_rating = case_when(height < 70 ~ "very small",
                                    height < 140 ~ "quite small",
                                    height < 200 ~ "medium",
                                    TRUE ~ "tall"))                                       
                                    
# recode based on multiple conditions
range(starwars$mass, na.rm = TRUE) # check range of mass, second vairable to recode by

starwars_rated <-  starwars %>% 
   mutate(height_rating = case_when((height < 70) & (mass < 700)~ "very small and light",
                                    height < 140 ~ "quite small",
                                    height < 200 ~ "medium",
                                    TRUE ~ "tall"))
          
```

#### Tips for newcomers

* Projects for everything! Using R Projects allows you to keep separate projects... separate! And find files easily. Start organised to stay organised.
* *R 4 Data Science* book: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/


#### Code snippets

##### Export to CSV

```r
# export with write.csv()
write.csv(ToothGrowth,
          file = "exports/tooth_growth.csv",
          row.names = FALSE, # remove rowname column
          na = "") # empty cell instead of "NA"
```

##### Missing data handling in `dplyr::filter()`

```r
# insert missing data:
ToothGrowth[27,3] <- NA
library(dplyr)
# dplyr filtering:
filtered_dplyr <- filter(ToothGrowth, dose > 0.5)
    # dplyr filter gets rid of rows returning NA
# base indexing:
filtered_base <- ToothGrowth[ToothGrowth$dose > 0.5, ]
    # base subsetting with [] keeps rows returning NA
# check documentation:
?dplyr::filter
```

> "[In `dplyr::filter`], note that when a condition evaluates to NA the row will be dropped, unlike base subsetting with `[`."

##### New `alt` argument in ggplot2

Great news for accessibility in the new ggplot2 version 3.3.4: https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/news/news.html

For example:

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = supp, y = len)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(alt = "Boxplot of tooth growth rate with different supplements.\n
       The length is generally higher with the OJ supplement.")
```

This will allow tools that create documents that include ggplot2 visualisations to make use of the alternative text, for screen readers for example.

Know that R Markdown has the chunk option `fig.alt` for that purpose as well.

```r
stringr::str_pad(c(0, 14, 178), width = 3, pad = 0)
```

#### This week's TidyTuesday

Have fun with this week's [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): the rKenyaCensus dataset.

#### Phoebe's faceted visualisation

Phoebe needed to reshape her dataset to then visualise it in separate facets.

```r
 CBMI %>% 
        select(Gender, contains("BMI")) %>% 
        pivot_longer(contains("BMI"), names_to="Year", values_to="BMI") %>% 
        mutate(Year=fct_inorder(Year)) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(x=Gender, y=BMI)) + 
        geom_boxplot() +
        facet_grid(cols=vars(Year)) +
        theme_pubr()
```

#### Recommendations for Katherine's bar chart

```r
library(ggplot2)

# useful geometries:
geom_bar() # height of a bar is a count
geom_col() # if you already have the value for the height of the bar

# to have bars side by side, change the position to "dodge"
# (instead of the default "stack"), for example:
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = as.character(cyl), fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

# for adding error bars
geom_errorbar()
# you have to provide the values for the size of the bars (xmin, xmax)
# and their position (x, y)
```

You might find that an extra package to add on top of ggplot2 will do the hard work for you. Many are listed here: https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/

#### Today's challenge

Try playing with the latest TidyTuesday dataset: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-10-13/readme.md

Share your findings and cool visualisations with the group!

#### Recoding data

This is a working example of recoding using dplyr's `case_when()`:

```r
library(dplyr)
CO2 %>% 
  mutate(uptake = case_when(
    uptake > 12 ~ "yay!",
    uptake > 10 ~ "OK.",
    TRUE ~ "oh no..."
  ))
```

The `TRUE` line is for "everything else".

#### Finding files

The "working directory" is the default location:

```r
getwd() # know where you are
setwd("path/to/correct/location") # change it

# functions will look there by default
read.csv("filename.csv")
# but you can use longer, absolute filepaths
read.csv("C:/Users/myname/filename.csv")
```

If you don't want to deal with that: **use R Projects**! Creating an R Project will set the working directory for you.

#### Dealing with overflowing labels

```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar()

# horizontal bar chart
ggplot(diamonds, aes(y = cut)) +
  geom_bar()

# abbreviate the labels
abbreviate(diamonds$cut)

# using it in the visualisation is nice and concise
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)
```

On the other hand, if labels are overflowing inside the canvas, we can expand axis limits:

```r
# expand limits
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ylim(c(0, 25000))
```

However, ggplot2 should expand the plot area to include all the geometries automatically, including a `geom_label()` or `geom_text()`.

### 2020-06-15: UQRUG 6

Anything you'd like to talk about? A problem? Resources? Feel free to add it here!

* **Stéphane Guillou** (Library): I will maintain the package [rinat](https://github.com/ropensci/rinat) from now on. If you have time, I'd love *you* to test it and report issues!
* **Ismail Garba** (SAFS): PhD researcher working on modeling covercropping in drylands for improved agronomic and environmental outcomes under current and future climates. I'm interested in using R to run APSIM model for multi-factor long term simulations.
* **Ruth Brady** (HMNS): PhD researcher working with accelerometers to measure physical activity patterns of adults. The package I am most interested in, is GGIR and creating a code that runs. I have basic R and GGIR knowledge but constantly run into problems I am unsure how to correct them. 
* **Chantelle Derez** (Biological Sciences): PhD researcher loving and hating making maps. I have an error relating to JAVA that would be great to get some help on. 
* **Adriana Vega** (SAFS) PhD studying tropical tree water use. Currently trying to use dendrometer (tree stem radius variations) data to separate "growth" from "water deficit". Hoping to get some advice on how to run a line through time series to separate these two components.
* **Clarisse Louvard**(SBS):PhD candidate studying parasites. First time at UQRUG. Currently searching for a way to do Principal Component Analyses with imputed datasets obtained with R package MICE.
* **Paula Andrea Martinez** I work for the National Imaging Facility, happy to help people with data organisation, data cleaning and munging. I'm also quite interested in web scrapping and APIs. I've worked with Bioconductor packages for some years too.

* **Greg Siemon** PhD Candidate working on optimisation of energy use within a steelworks. I have done most of my PhD work in R and I am going to be writing my Thesis using RMarkdown (See unofficial RMarkdown Thesis template below). At the moment I'm trying to parse some messy XML formatted output from some optimisation software. If anyone is familiar with the XML2 package I'd be interested to have a chat.
* **Patrick Di** (*SAFS*) Undergraduate Honours student who is studying R for genetics and GIS. Data management and plotting nice figures. :1234: 

### 2020-05-18: UQRUG 5

We are meeting online again!

Today, we talk about whatever issues you might have, as well as **reprex** and **R 4.0**.

#### Attendees

Feel free to share your contact, specialty and questions here.

* **Steph** (UQ Library), technology trainer, likes R and maps and Open Science.
    * Email (work): s.guillou@uq.edu.au ; Social (personal): [mastodon](https://mastodon.indie.host/@stragu/)
* **Paula**

#### reprex

The **reprex** website introduces what the reprex package is useful for, i.e. creating **reproducible examples**: https://reprex.tidyverse.org/

Share your reprex example here!

Steph's:

``` r
# R 4.0 does not import strings as factors by default anymore!

# create a fake dataframe:
df <- data.frame(ID = LETTERS[1:10],
                 gender = sample(c("man", "woman", "enby", "other", "PNS"),
                                 10, replace = TRUE),
                 age = sample(1:100,
                              10, replace = TRUE))

# check class
class(df$gender)
#> [1] "character"

# summary() might be a bit less informative
summary(df)
#>       ID               gender               age       
#>  Length:10          Length:10          Min.   : 5.00

Example code used during the meetup:

```r
# R 4.0 updates

# does not import strings as factors by default anymore!

# create a fake dataframe:
df <- data.frame(ID = LETTERS[1:15],
                 gender = sample(c("man", "woman", "enby", "fluid", "other", "PNS"),
                                 15, replace = TRUE),
                 age = sample(1:100, 15, replace = TRUE),
                 score = sample(10:300, 15, replace = TRUE))

# check class
class(df$gender)

typeof(as.factor(df$gender))


# summary() might be a bit less informative
summary(df)

# default palette
plot(df$age, df$score, col = as.factor(df$gender))
# see the values
palette()

# class inheritance
class(diag(1))

# warning when joining datasets with different factor levels
# create two datasets:
df1 <- data.frame(name =  c("blah", "bloh"),
                  height = c(123, 234),
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
df2 <- data.frame(name =  c("blah", "blih"),
                  weight = c(456, 678),
                  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# dplyr warns when joining by a key that does not share
# the exact same levels between the two tables
library(dplyr)
joined <- left_join(df1, df2)
# see that it converted to characters for safety
str(joined)
# see that original levels differ
df1$name
df2$name

# revtools
library(revtools)
# show all available data objects
data()

?revtools

```

The code we worked on:

```r
# construct dataframe containing relevant data
site_number <- c(1, 2) # there are 2 numbers for this variable (1 and 2)
year <- c(2001, 2002) # there are 2 years (2001, 2002) 
veg_index <- c("EVI", "EVI2") # there are 2 VegIndices (EVI, EVI2)
# put everything together
df <- data.frame(site_number, year, veg_index)

# find all combinations of values
library(tidyr)
expanded <- expand(df, site_number, year, veg_index)

# create a path from other variables
library(dplyr)
with_paths <- expanded %>% 
  mutate(path = paste0("beginning/", site_number, "_", year, "-", veg_index))

# encapsulate code into a function
do_stats <- function(df, numCores) {
  siteShp <- readRDS(df$path)
  calcPixelwiseStats(siteShp, Year = df$year, removeBadGrads = removeBadGrads, optionsYldIdx = setOptionsYldIdx(minevitrees = 999, ndaysbeforemax4yldidx = 60, ndaysaftermax4yldidx = 60, VegIndex = df$veg_index), numCores = numCores, getFromBricks = FALSE)
}

# apply the custom function on 1-row tibbles by splitting
library(purrr)
siteInfoAllYrs <- with_paths %>% 
  split(1:nrow(with_paths)) %>% # create sequence as long as number of rows
  map(do_stats, numCores = 4)
# we end up with a list of results

# Other option: with pmap, which will work row-wise
# (which is why we have to have the df variables in the right order)
do_stats2 <- function(site_number, year, veg_index, path, numCores) {
  siteShp <- readRDS(path)
  calcPixelwiseStats(siteShp, Year = year, removeBadGrads = removeBadGrads, optionsYldIdx = setOptionsYldIdx(minevitrees = 999, ndaysbeforemax4yldidx = 60, ndaysaftermax4yldidx = 60, VegIndex = veg_index), numCores = numCores, getFromBricks = FALSE)
}

# apply the function row-wise
siteInfoAllYrs <- pmap(with_paths, do_stats2, numCore = 4)

# small example of how pmap works row-wise:
x <- c(1, 10, 100)
y <- c(1, 2, 3)
z <- c(5, 50, 500)
examp <- data.frame(x, y, z)
pmap(examp, sum)
```
