When using the same code for a slightly different sample group, the colours on the chart changed. We spent some time trying to find the cause of this, such as slight differences in the code, but we didn’t come to a solution. We will next try converting the data to fit into a ggplot.\nOlive Dang ggplot2 legend order Olive needed help changing the order of some variables in a ggplot legend. We accomplished this by turning that column of the dataframe into a facotr with levels. E.g. :\ndf$col &lt;- factor(df$col, levels=c('a', 'b', 'c'))\nOlive Dang ggplot2 and ggarrange making all the graphs the same size Olive had a second question about ggplot when exporting them onto the same page. There was an issue where they weren’t lining up very well (the top graph was smaller). We spent some time trying to resolve this issue, however, it turns out that there is an argument in ggarrange which allows you to quickly make them the same size. The align argument allows you to align graphs along the vertical axis, horizontal axis, or both.\nAinnatul Adawiyah Ahmad Termizi on using R over Excel Ainnatul wanted to recreate some graphs and statistical analyses that had been made in Excel in R. We recommended checking out some of the introduction to R classes that we run, as well as the ANOVA class that we have a guide for."

I can’t stay to long as I have to go track carpet pythons at 4pm ;)\nEinat (Social Sciences, R studio beginner): Apologies in advance would have to leave early. have some issues wiTh minor and basic procedures, like …CONDITIONS!! and also with reading labels from csv/excel file.\nPatrick (Agricultural Science) Honours student\nGabriel: Hydrologist, spatial data analyst. PhD candidate at SMI. R beginner and Python enthusiast !\nNatalie (Mathematics): Undergraduate Mathematics and Statistics student\nPhoebe: learn more about data viz!\n… and few more!\n\n\n\nToday’s challenge\nTry playing with the latest TidyTuesday dataset: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-10-13/readme.md\nShare your findings and cool visualisations with the group!\n\n\nRecoding data\nThis is a working example of recoding using dplyr’s case_when():\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nCO2 %&gt;% \n  mutate(uptake = case_when(\n    uptake &gt; 12 ~ \"yay!\",\n    uptake &gt; 10 ~ \"OK.\",\n    TRUE ~ \"oh no...\"\n  ))\n\nThe TRUE line is for “everything else”.\n\n\nFinding files\nThe “working directory” is the default location:\n\ngetwd() # know where you are\nsetwd(\"path/to/correct/location\") # change it\n\n# functions will look there by default\nread.csv(\"filename.csv\")\n# but you can use longer, absolute filepaths\nread.csv(\"C:/Users/myname/filename.csv\")\n\nIf you don’t want to deal with that: use R Projects! Creating an R Project will set the working directory for you.\n\n\nDealing with overflowing labels\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n# horizontal bar chart\nggplot(diamonds, aes(y = cut)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n# abbreviate the labels\nabbreviate(diamonds$cut)\n\n# using it in the visualisation is nice and concise\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)\n\nOn the other hand, if labels are overflowing inside the canvas, we can expand axis limits:\n\n# expand limits\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  ylim(c(0, 25000))\n\nHowever, ggplot2 should expand the plot area to include all the geometries automatically, including a geom_label() or geom_text().\n\n\nShared resources\nResources shared during the meetup can be listed here:\n\nPackages:\n\nepiDisplay: https://rdrr.io/cran/epiDisplay/\nlme4: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lme4/versions/1.1-23/topics/lme4-package\nSeurat: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Seurat/index.html\nreshape2: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html\n\nFunctions:\n\ncase_when() to recode a variable: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/case_when.html\n\nData viz:\n\nggplot2 extensions: https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/\nData to Viz: https://www.data-to-viz.com/\nlattice: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lattice/versions/0.20-41"

You may want to be looking for certain keywords.\nYou would likely run into issues with nuance and insight.\nIf the questions can be answered by a machine, then it can be marked by a machine. If it requires insight, then no.\nTo do this in R would likely require a lot of backend work to effectively create an AI similar to chatGPT which is capable of dealing with free text input, and providing feedback from there.\n\n\nWhat are you using R for?\n\nI am using R for Reporting and data analysis.\nI use R for data analysis and graphs\nI use R to analyse data. Big data. Running loops in parallel has proved difficult. Using parallel and foreach\nEnvironmental analysis - using seqinr and BALCONY\nI use R for bioinformatics for dna sequencing analysis."

When a test (like ANOVA) has a normality assumption is ussualy refer to normality of data (value). But it will depend on the test.\nKar: Thank you very much Raul.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nUsing the irr package which has a icc function. Then you simply feed that the dataframe and the parameters/model you’re using to calculate the corrlelations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nRaul:Maybe this will help? https://rpubs.com/bensonsyd/385183 “however, in many multiple linear regression situations, the variables we are using cannot be simultaneously represented two-dimensionally so exploring the data visually is far more difficult”. All good. It looks like we can’t really graph multiple linear regression easily. Thanks a lot.\n\nMaybe explore these visualisations? https://statsandr.com/blog/multiple-linear-regression-made-simple/#visualizations-1\n\nIf there are interactions between multiple variables then you can’t visualise that easily.\nYou would have to visualise the plot at different levels of the interaction, as the slope and corrleation would be different at every level of the interaction\nIf you have 2 independent variables, you need three dimensions to visualise each variable, and their interaction. OR have a 2D plot at each level of the interaction - like slices through each of those\nThe only time this is fine is if there is no interaction between the variables, and you can collapse that extra dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example nearest street address to a GPS coordinate\nAnswers\n\nhttps://rdrr.io/cran/tmaptools/man/rev_geocode_OSM.html\nhttps://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nRaul: Not familiar with genepop package, but according to the manual, they have a LD (linkage desequilibrium) test.

Residual normality or Data value normality\nAnswers\n\nRaul: In general, Residual normality is used to test if your data adjust to a linear model. When a test (like ANOVA) has a normality assumption is ussualy refer to normality of data (value). But it will depend on the test.\nKar: Thank you very much Raul.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nUsing the irr package which has a icc function. Then you simply feed that the dataframe and the parameters/model you’re using to calculate the corrlelations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nRaul:Maybe this will help? https://rpubs.com/bensonsyd/385183 “however, in many multiple linear regression situations, the variables we are using cannot be simultaneously represented two-dimensionally so exploring the data visually is far more difficult”. All good. It looks like we can’t really graph multiple linear regression easily. Thanks a lot.\n\nMaybe explore these visualisations? https://statsandr.com/blog/multiple-linear-regression-made-simple/#visualizations-1\n\nIf there are interactions between multiple variables then you can’t visualise that easily.\nYou would have to visualise the plot at different levels of the interaction, as the slope and corrleation would be different at every level of the interaction\nIf you have 2 independent variables, you need three dimensions to visualise each variable, and their interaction. OR have a 2D plot at each level of the interaction - like slices through each of those\nThe only time this is fine is if there is no interaction between the variables, and you can collapse that extra dimension.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example nearest street address to a GPS coordinate\nAnswers\n\nhttps://rdrr.io/cran/tmaptools/man/rev_geocode_OSM.html\nhttps://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\nRaul: Not familiar with genepop package, but according to the manual, they have a LD (linkage desequilibrium) test. The function is\n\ntest_LD(\ninputFile,\noutputFile = \"\",\nsettingsFile = \"\",\ndememorization = 10000,\nbatches = 100,\niterations = 5000,\nverbose = interactive()\n)"
