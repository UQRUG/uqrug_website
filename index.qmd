UQRUG is a **gathering for R users of all skills**, to help each other solve problems, to share resources and tips, and to simply hang out with a nice community.

### When do we meet?

We meet **every last Thursday of the month** 10-12 pm, online and in person: sign up to the next event by searching for UQRUG on the [Library training page](https://web.library.uq.edu.au/library-services/training)

### How do I get the Zoom link?

If you have a UQ affiliated account, you can sign up to the event directly through the StudentHub link found in the **Next Workshop** below.

Otherwise you can email the UQ Library training team for more help and to get Zoom access: <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="copyEvent('copy')" id="copy" title="Click to copy email address">training\@library.uq.edu.au</a>
