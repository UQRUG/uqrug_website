### 2020-07-27: UQRUG 7

On Zoom, 3-5 pm.

#### Attendees and problems

* **St√©phane** (Library): anyone with experience with Tidyverse + quosure / quasiquotation? I want to use strings in one column as object names in a function.
* **Ruth** (HMNS): I don't have any specific issues this week. I am happy to listen and explore new packages.
* **Chantelle Derez** (Biological Science): I don't have any specific issues, just popping in to learn. Current favourite package is Thermimage and colour palette 'rainbow' for analysing thermal images. :rainbow: 
* **Paula Andrea M** (CAI) I'm here to help. Also I would like to invite you to the Rladies Brisbane events. https://www.meetup.com/rladies-brisbane/events/272075776 The topic of next month is R in Biology. 
* **Fathin** (SAFS) No issue to date. 
* **Damber** (I want to learn plotting glmm prediction) - shared on chat.uq.edu as well.
* **Candice**: RNAseq in R.
    * Found resources:
    * https://osca.bioconductor.org
    * https://bioconductor.riken.jp/packages/3.8/workflows/html/simpleSingleCell.html 
* **Greg** (Chemical Engineering) Late but here to help. Currently grappling with some nasty XML at the moment that I want to parse efficiently.  Writing my PhD thesis in RMarkdown.

#### From today's questions

* Reading XML data into R
    * https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/big_data_and_business_intelligence/9781783989065/1/ch01lvl1sec11/reading-xml-data
    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40977885/extracting-nodes-by-name
    * Greg also this code worked well for missing nodes, but not for repeated names. Have a try

```
library(XML)
library(methods)

xmldata <- xmlToDataFrame("data/plant_catalog_incomplete.xml")
View(xmldata)
```

* For Single cell analysis
