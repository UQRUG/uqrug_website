#### Topics discussed and code

##### Presentation on quanteda

Nick Wiggins did a presentation on the quanteda package to give an overview and introduction to the package and how he has recently used it to assist a researcher. https://quanteda.io/

##### Kar ggplot facet_wrap label issue

Kar has the below sample data set:

```         
MyID    eventA review   eventB review   eventC review
id_68   very good   neutral 
id_30   very good   very good   
id_15   good    very good   
id_1    neutral very good   
![](https://s3.hedgedoc.org/demo/uploads/6f9d7f0d-202b-4549-b7b1-186dbe9bb093.png)
```

He is trying to create a facet_wrap in ggplot that includes labels that are missing from the data, but needed to scale "bad" & "very bad", while having the y labels showing on every facet. Without manually creating each y scale.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# Data transformation
trial %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(2:3), names_to = "events", values_to = "review") %>% 
  count(events, review) %>% 
  rbind(tibble(events = c("eventA review", "eventA review"),
               review = c("bad", "very bad"),
               n = c(NA, NA))) %>%
  mutate(events = as.factor(events),
         review = as.factor(review)) %>% 
# plot
  ggplot(aes(y = review, x = n, fill = events)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~events) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

##### Sogra stat comparison issue

Sogra has a large dataset of protein observations and needs to compare between different groups.

Using the package **MSstats** Sogra needs to re-export that data.

##### Semira

Semira is trying to change the colours of the diamonds in a forest plot created using the **meta** package. We've tried change the col.diamonds to set the colours, however this changed all of the boxes in the forest plot.
