### R Overview of the Month

This month at UQRUG, for the End of Year we will be having the **Cool But Useless** competition, where community members will share their creative code that shows off some fun things you can do with R.

### Questions

#### Q1 - How to tell R in my model that I have repeated measurements: a bit of background

I have this model - my supervisor uses sas and and sas you can tell the model the experimental unit

summary(lmer(log_Grazing_Percentage \~ Period + Count_RSSI_GE_Minus50 + Period:Count_RSSI_GE_Minus50 + (1 + Count_RSSI_GE_Minus50 \| Animal_id:Period), data = fp)) Fixed effects: Estimate Std. Error df t value Pr(\>\|t\|)\
(Intercept) 1.274369 0.057739 36.627445 22.071 \<2e-16 \*\* *Period -0.012289 0.035668 33.633624 -0.345 0.7326\
Count_RSSI_GE_Minus50 0.006682 0.003264 473.393660 2.047 0.0412* \
Period:Count_RSSI_GE_Minus50 -0.003470 0.001700 459.550503 -2.041 0.0418 \*

The problem I am having is that I want the df to be 26, not these others because they are all repeated measurements for the same 14 animals in 2 different periods. Is there a function that I can use so that R is a repeated measurement? Or say to R the Period and Animals they are the experimental unit?
