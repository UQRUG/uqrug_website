#### Using taskscheduleR to automate your R scripts

At UQRUG this month, we have an overview of the <a href="taskscheduleR package - RDocumentation">taskscheduleR</a> package by Luke Gaiter.

He will show showcase the usage of the [taskscheduleR](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/taskscheduleR/versions/1.8) package for automating the running of your scripts on a schedule. This is useful is you find yourself gathering data from a source that updates frequently.
