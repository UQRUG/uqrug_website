## Questions and resources shared

R for spatial data:

-   ggplot2 has coordinate systems for maps too (with `coord_sf()`)

-   To process vector data: sf <https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/>

-   To process raster data: terra <https://rspatial.github.io/terra/>

-   tmap for static and interactive visualisations: <https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/>

-   Book: <https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/>

-   CRAN task view on spatial: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Spatial.html>

-   ROpenSci gives access to packages for spatial processing and data downloads: <https://ropensci.org/>

-   Example of acquiring OSM data, using sf and sfnetworks for spatial networks, and tmap for an interactive visualisation: <https://stragu.gitlab.io/blog/2022-06-06-spatial-networks/>

Spatial data sources:

-   <https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/,> for example for Digital Elevation Model (DEM), there's SRTM

-   <https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home>

-   <https://digital.atlas.gov.au/>

Community of practice for spatial stuff: <https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/>

Resources for (time series) modelling:

-   <https://www.tidymodels.org/> which works hand-in-hand with <https://www.tidyverse.org/>

-   `arima()` in core R (stats package)
