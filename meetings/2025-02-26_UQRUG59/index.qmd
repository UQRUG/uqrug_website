## Topic: R environments with renv

You can test cloning the example project: <https://github.com/stragu/renv_example>

From the command line:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/stragu/renv_example.git
```

Then open the project and see what renv does to adapt your local envrionment according to the renv.lock file.

## Questions and shared resources
