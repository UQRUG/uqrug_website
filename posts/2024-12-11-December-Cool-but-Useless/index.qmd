In this special End of Year edition of UQRUG we will be holding a **competition** to see who can create the **Coolest and Most Useless R code** (on the special date of **Wednesday the 11th of December, 12-2pm**). We're looking for creativity and entertainment value, so perhaps you'll find a hilarious use of an R package, or maybe you can chain together an entertaining string of functions.

For examples of things you could submit, please see [last year's examples](https://uqrug.netlify.app/presentations/23-11-cool/23-11-cool.html) that Nick put together.

The winner will be chosen by those attending. They will not only receive the honourable title of **"Coolest and Most Useless"**, but also a special prize! All other entrants will receive a prize too!

To apply, simply show up to UQRUG on the 11th (or send us an email beforehand with your code if you can't make it)!
