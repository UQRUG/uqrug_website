Time for our monthly drop-in session, so bring your questions as well as your latest creations and great resources you've discovered!

Stéphane will do a quick intro to [rix](https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/): a package that snapshots your whole environment (not only the packages, like renv does, but also the R version and the system dependencies). This is helpful to guarantee that your code can always run in the future, and to improve reproducibility of your results.
