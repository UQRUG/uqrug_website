Before we jump into our help session for everyone to ask questions, Stéphane will be providing an overview of the [tinyplot](https://grantmcdermott.com/tinyplot/) data visualisation package: a powerful, lightweight alternative to base R plots and ggplot2.

Drop in, and bring your questions as well as your latest creations and great resources you've discovered!
