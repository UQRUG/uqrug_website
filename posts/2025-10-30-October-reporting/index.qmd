Before we jump into our help session for everyone to ask questions, **Kar** will present about data manipulation, creating tables and compiling everything into reports. In Kar's words:

> **Data Manipulation, Tabling and Reporting with R: dplyr, kableExtra, and RMarkdown**
>
> I will share how I use prestigious functions in the *dplyr* package for data manipulation, along with layering techniques for the *kableExtra* package to create polished tables in an R Markdown report.
>
> This is Kar, a senior anti-money laundering data analyst for the Bank of Queensland (BOQ). R has been my best buddy for 8 years for DA and DS, I also run R training sessions at BOQ for BOQ data science community as a R facilitator.
