This month, the participants in the Library's [R Intensive](https://uqlibrary.github.io/technology-training-intensives/r/setup.html) meet RUG!

Nick will start with a quickfire intro to visualising spatial data with [tmap](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/), before we do our usual collaborative help session.

As the R Intensive runs all day that day, RUG will happen at the same time. This is an opportunity to welcome our new R users to RUG, and still bring a question and share helpful resources if you have them!
