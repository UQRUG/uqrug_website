This month's RUG is a quick intro to **Positron**, followed by our usual drop-in, collaborative session.

[Positron](https://positron.posit.co) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Posit (ex-RStudio) and based on VS Code. It can be seen as the successor to RStudio. You can download and install it before the event if you want to follow along.
